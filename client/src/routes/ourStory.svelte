<h3 class="[ color__primary heading__1">Our Story</h3>
<span class="body__1">Like every good relationship, Bianca and Michael's story started with friendship.</span>
<div class="[ inset ]">
    <h4 class="[ color__primary heading__4 ]">How we met</h4>
    <p class=" [ inset body__1 ]">
    It was August of 2013 when the pair first met at Texas A&M's freshman orientation, known as <b>Fish Camp</b>.
    Out of the thousands of starting freshman ( known as "fish" as A&M ), hundreds of them sign up for Fish Camp.
    Those hundreds are split into camp sessions A, B, C, ... etc, each camp session split into five colors, 
    and each color split into small designated groups (DGs) of about 8-10 people. Whether it was by God's choice, or 
    a random chance of fate ( ~0.0013% liklihood), Michael and Bianca were paired together in Session F's purple DG
    "Barbed Wire with Salad Fingers". Did they hit it off right away ? They'd say no... however this did plant the seed to what
    was to come.

    <h4 class="[ color__primary heading__4 ]">The Unplanned date</h4>
    <p>
        Freshman year of college and the following summer had past, and the pair was back in College Station for their Sophomore year.
        It was a busy year. On top of school, Bianca had joined a Women's Organization called Legacies, 
        Michael started building camaraderie with and developing the A&M Men's Water Polo team.

        Eager to see their friends,
